Switched to branch 'master'
```
$ git checkout master
```

Switched to a new branch "iss53"
```
$ git checkout -b iss53
```

If you used above approach to create new branch on the fly, you must push the current branch and set remote as upstream
```
git push --set-upstream origin cursor-approach
```
